First read me file!
entered directly in the github. First we have to pull this readme file in to the local git from the github. 
I just created a readme file in github, used Rstudio and pull command in the terminal window to pull the readme file into Rstudio under files. Opened the readme file, add this line-3 in it and now trying to push changes back to the githbu. Let's check it out :)

NOTE: the changes made in the readme file, won't appear like 1, 2,... 5 numbers as it appears in the Rstudio readme file
